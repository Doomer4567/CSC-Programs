Intractable problems can be too difficult for even the largest supercomputers

Find algorithms that grow more efficiently
	intractable problems may become manageable

Quantum Computing

Physicist
	Quantum Physics, Computer Scientists found they could (in theory) exploit this newly discovered behavior to create more efficient algorithms
	Ex. integer Factorization: integer x
		find p,q such that x = p q

RSA(encryption)
	p,q large prime numbers
		factoring 617-RSA number is intractable in supercomputer BUT can be done in under a day with a quantum computer
