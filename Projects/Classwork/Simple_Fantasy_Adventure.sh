echo "Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like $1 (hey, what up girl?) Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this $UsrHome.
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a $UsrWeapon 'Cause when I leave for the night. I ain't comin' back I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes. Boys blowin' up our phones, phones. Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to $UsrMotive Tryna get a little bit tipsy. Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'Til we see the sunlight. Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no
Oh, whoa, whoa-oh Oh, whoa, whoa-oh"
